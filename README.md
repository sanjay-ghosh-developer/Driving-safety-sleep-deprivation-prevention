Nowadays, more and more professions require long-term concentration. Drivers must keep a close eye on the road, so they can react to sudden events immediately. Driver fatigue often becomes a direct cause of many traffic accidents. Therefore, there is a need to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents. However, the development of such systems encounters many difficulties related to fast and proper recognition of a driverâ€™s fatigue symptoms. One of the technical possibilities to implement driver drowsiness detection systems is to use the vision-based approach.
